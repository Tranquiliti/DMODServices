Version 0.3.0

* Changed select D-Mod picker to use an actual selection screen.
  - Still only one D-Mod that can be picked at a time; if multiple are selected, only the top-most D-Mod will be chosen.
  - Obviously not ideal, but, IMO, an improvement from needing to cycle through the same button many times.
* Updated LunaLib compatibility; mod now requires at least LunaLib v1.7.4



Version 0.2.0

* Updated to Starsector 0.96a-RC6
* Changed price scaling for adding a selected D-Mod; should be cheaper overall.



Version 0.1.1

* Ship selection screen now shows at most 7 ships per row (from 5), to match the "Your fleet" screen.
* Other, very minor changes



Version 0.1.0

* Initial release
