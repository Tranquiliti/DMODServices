D-MOD welcomes any spacers who offer their ships as target practice in any of D-MOD's weapon demonstrations. These demonstrations provide both entertainment to the local populace and a practical option for retiring captains wishing to cement their own decisions. Barring that, the more technical and savvy D-MOD employees seek out ships to creatively ""modify"", a desire largely satisfied by superstitious - yet wealthy - space captains who believe that a broken-down ship performs better than a pristine one.

After a short wait, a D-MOD representative establishes a comm-link with you to discuss their services and answer any queries you might have.",,

Soon after, a battery of Hellbore Cannons pound the helpless ship, forming a cloud of metal and fire around it. The barrage of explosions rock the demonstration area, shaking the ground beneath you and causing some of your crew to instinctually duck for cover. Once the Hellbore battery ceases and the smoke finally clears, you see the ship still barely-intact, wondering how it even managed to survive all of that. As soon as you finish that thought, however, the ship's hull suddenly collapses onto itself, inciting cheers from the crowd of spectators as the D-MOD employee overseeing the demonstration formally ends the event.

Surprisingly, all the weapons fire have not completely ruined the ship, despite the heavy damage. Eventually, D-MOD engineers recover the ship to a usable state and send it back to you.

You have offered a ship to the D-MOD representative. An hour later, they invite you and your crew to their demonstration area, where you then find the ship sitting inert.

Soon after, a Reaper-class torpedo slams into the lifeless hull, creating a nuclear explosion so powerful the containment fields protecting you and the other spectators start to visibly vibrate, making some of the spectators scream in fear. Fortunately, the explosion eventually subsides, allowing an unobstructed view of the obliterated target: a heap of burning metal, providing a beautiful, warm light inside the demonstration area. The event ends with the D-MOD employee overseeing the demonstration making an impassioned speech about the destructive beauty of the Reaper.

Soon after, a flash of light suddenly strikes the dormant ship, then another flash joins in the fray. Before long, the impressive array of ship-grade beams, ranging from modest Tactical Lasers to awe-inspiring Tachyon Lances, create a spectacular lightshow, to the delight of your crew and the other spectators - although the ship itself certainly isn't enjoying this at all. After the lightshow display finishes, what was once a functional ship is now a steaming scrap heap, comprised of little more than the scarred and sliced-off pieces of its former glory.

After a short while, and to your surprise, the D-MOD representative requests that you provide them any data that would assist the service in creating automated ships. It seems this particular D-MOD center considers the profit made from complying with your request worth the off-chance that a zealous Hegemony AI inspector might inspect the center for ""suspicious activity"".

As you order your fleet technicians to transmit any and all data pertaining to automating human-crewed ships, the D-MOD representative warns you that such a specialized service comes with huge expenses - some of which, you suspect, may be used to pay off any potential AI inspections against the D-MOD center. Also, due to D-MOD's lack of documentation and experience, the automation process will not only inflict permanent damage on the ship, but the invasive - and highly complex - nature of this process will completely prevent any future ship restoration, making any ship damage incurred during and after the process permanent.",,
