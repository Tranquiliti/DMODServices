D-MOD welcomes any spacers who offer their ships as target practice in any of D-MOD's weapon demonstrations. These demonstrations provide both entertainment to the local populace and a practical option for retiring captains wishing to cement their decision. Barring that, the more technical and savvy D-MOD employees seek out ships to creatively ""modify"", a desire largely satisfied by superstitious - yet wealthy - space captains who think that a broken-down ship performs better than a pristine one.

Eventually, a D-MOD representative establishes a comm-link with you to discuss their services and answer any queries you might have.",,

Soon after, a battery of Hellbore Cannons pound the helpless ship, forming a cloud of metal and fire around it. The explosions from each hit rock the demonstration area, shaking the ground beneath you and, for some of your crew, causing them to duck in response. Once the Hellbore battery ceases and the smoke finally clears, you see the ship still barely-intact, wondering how it even managed to survive all of that. As soon as you finish that thought, however, the ship's hull suddenly collapses into itself, inciting cheers from the crowd of spectators as the D-MOD employee overseeing the demonstration formally ends the event.

Surprisingly, all the weapons fire have not completely ruined the ship, despite the heavy damage. Eventually, D-MOD engineers recover the ship to a usable state and send the ship back to you.

You have offered a ship to the D-MOD representative. An hour later, they invite you and your crew to their demonstration area, where you then find the ship sitting inert.

Soon after, a Reaper-class torpedo slams into the lifeless hull, creating a nuclear explosion so powerful the containment fields protecting you and the other spectators start to visibly vibrate, making some of the spectators scream in fear. Fortunately, the explosion eventually subsides, allowing an unobstructed view of the obliterated target, a heap of burning metal providing a beautiful, warm light within the demonstration area. The event ends with the D-MOD employee overseeing the demonstration making am impassioned speech about the destructive beauty of the Reaper-class torpedo.

You have offered a ship to the D-MOD representative. An hour later, they invite you and your crew to their demonstration area, where you then find the ship sitting inert.

Soon after, a flash of light suddenly strikes the dormant ship, then another flash joins in the fray. Before long, the impressive array of beams, ranging from modest Tactical Lasers to awe-inspiring Tachyon Lances, create a spectacular lightshow, to the delight of your crew and the other spectators - although the ship itself certainly isn't enjoying this at all. After the lightshow display finishes, what was once a recognizble hull is now a steaming scrap heap, scarred and deformed by countless beam slices.
